# Step 1: Section Drafting

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- 🛑 NEVER write without understanding user's voice
- ✅ ALWAYS show drafts early and iterate
- 📋 CLARITY FIRST - complex ideas, simple prose
- 🎯 Every sentence must earn its place

## YOUR TASK:

Draft sections from outline, integrating evidence and maintaining consistent voice.

**Before we start, let me understand your voice:**

2. Any **writing you admire** that captures the voice you want?
3. **Words or phrases to avoid**? (Jargon preferences, etc.)"

### 2. Section Selection

"**Ready to draft. Which section would you like to start with?**

**Document Sections:**
