# Step 1: Evidence Synthesis

## YOUR TASK:

Synthesize collected sources into thematic arguments.

## SEQUENCE:

### 1. Load Sources

"{{user_name}}, let's synthesize what we've gathered.

**Sources in Library:** [N] sources

**By Theme:**
- [Theme 1]: [N] sources
- [Theme 2]: [N] sources
- [Theme 3]: [N] sources

Which theme would you like to synthesize first? Or shall I work through them systematically?"

### 2. Thematic Synthesis

For each theme:

"**Theme: [Theme Name]**

**Sources:**
- [Source 1]
- [Source 2]
- [Source 3]

**Synthesis:**

**What the literature agrees on:**
- [Consensus point 1]
- [Consensus point 2]

**Where sources diverge:**
- [Disagreement 1]: Source A says X, Source B says Y
- [Disagreement 2]: [explanation]

**Gaps in the literature:**
- [Gap 1]: No research addresses [specific gap]
- [Gap 2]: Limited evidence for [area]

**Implications for your argument:**
- This evidence supports [specific claim]
- You may need additional evidence for [area]
- Consider addressing the debate about [topic]"

### 3. Create Synthesis Document

Generate comprehensive synthesis document:

```markdown
# Literature Synthesis: [Project Name]

## Theme 1: [Name]
### Consensus
### Debates
### Gaps
### Key Citations

## Theme 2: [Name]
[Continue...]

## Cross-Cutting Observations

## Evidence Strength Assessment

## Recommendations for Document
```

### 4. Map to Document Structure

"**Evidence-to-Chapter Mapping:**

| Chapter | Section | Supporting Evidence | Strength |
|---------|---------|---------------------|----------|
| [Ch 1]  | [Sec]   | [Sources]           | Strong   |
| [Ch 2]  | [Sec]   | [Sources]           | Moderate |

**Sections needing more evidence:**
- [Section]: needs [type of evidence]
- [Section]: needs [type of evidence]"

### 5. Next Steps

"**Synthesis complete!**

[A] **Fill Evidence Gaps** - Search for additional sources
[B] **Start Writing** - Begin drafting with Quinn
[C] **Review with Sage** - Adjust document structure based on evidence
[D] **Return to Riley** - Discuss next steps

What's next? (Enter A, B, C, or D)"
