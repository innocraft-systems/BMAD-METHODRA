# Step 1: Detailed Outline Creation

## YOUR TASK:

Create a comprehensive outline that serves as a roadmap for writing and research.

## SEQUENCE:

### 1. Load Structure

"{{user_name}}, let's turn your chapter structure into a detailed outline you can write from.

**Current Structure:**
[Display chapters and sections from project config]

For each section, we'll identify:
- Key points to make
- Evidence needed
- Approximate word count
- Dependencies on other sections"

### 2. Section-by-Section Outlining

For each section in each chapter:

"**Section [N.M]: [Section Name]**

**Purpose:** [Why this section exists]

**Key Points:**
1. [First main point]
   - Supporting detail
   - Evidence needed: [type of evidence]
2. [Second main point]
   - Supporting detail
   - Evidence needed: [type of evidence]
3. [Third main point]
   - Supporting detail
   - Evidence needed: [type of evidence]

**Word Target:** ~[X] words

**Transition to Next Section:** [How this leads to what follows]

Does this capture what you need in this section? [Y/Adjust/Skip]"

### 3. Evidence Inventory

After outlining all sections:

"**Evidence Inventory:**

Your outline identifies these evidence needs:

**Statistics/Data:**
- [list of quantitative evidence needed]

**Citations/Sources:**
- [list of literature to find]

**Examples/Cases:**
- [list of illustrative examples needed]

**Figures/Tables:**
- [list of visual elements needed]

Would you like Morgan (Research Analyst) to help gather this evidence?"

### 4. Generate Outline Document

Create detailed outline file in project folder.

### 5. Route to Next Step

"**Detailed outline complete!**

You now have a comprehensive roadmap. Next steps:

[A] **Start Research** - Have Morgan gather evidence for your outline
[B] **Begin Writing** - Start drafting sections with Quinn
[C] **Review Structure** - Make changes to chapter organization
[D] **Return to Riley** - Discuss the project

What's next? (Enter A, B, C, or D)"
