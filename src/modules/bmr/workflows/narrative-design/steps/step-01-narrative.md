# Step 1: Narrative Arc Design

## YOUR TASK:

Help the user design a compelling narrative flow for their research document.

## SEQUENCE:

### 1. Introduction

"{{user_name}}, let's make your document tell a compelling story. Even rigorous research benefits from narrative structure - it helps readers follow your argument and remember your conclusions.

**Your current chapter structure:**
[Display chapters from project config]

Let me understand your narrative:

1. **What's the central tension or question** your document addresses?
2. **What's the transformation** - how should readers think differently after reading?
3. **What's your 'aha moment'** - the key insight everything builds toward?"

### 2. Map Narrative Structure

Based on responses, map to narrative framework:

**Research Narrative Arc:**
```
SETUP → TENSION → EXPLORATION → INSIGHT → RESOLUTION → IMPLICATIONS

Chapter Mapping:
- Setup: [chapters that establish context]
- Tension: [chapters that present the problem/gap]
- Exploration: [chapters that examine evidence]
- Insight: [chapters with key findings]
- Resolution: [chapters with conclusions]
- Implications: [chapters on broader impact]
```

### 3. Argument Flow Analysis

"**Your Argument Flow:**

```
[Chapter 1] establishes → [what foundation]
      ↓
[Chapter 2] builds tension by → [what conflict/gap]
      ↓
[Chapter 3] explores → [what evidence]
      ↓
[Continue mapping...]
      ↓
[Final Chapter] resolves with → [what conclusion]
```

**Strength Analysis:**
- ✓ Strong transitions: [list]
- ⚠ Potential gaps: [list]
- 💡 Enhancement opportunities: [list]"

### 4. Refine Transitions

"For each chapter transition, let's ensure smooth flow:

**[Chapter N] → [Chapter N+1]**
- Current bridge: [how they connect now]
- Suggested transition: [improved connection]
- Reader question answered: [what readers wonder that next chapter addresses]"

### 5. Create Narrative Map

Generate visual/textual narrative map and save to project.

### 6. Update Project & Route

"**Narrative arc is designed!**

Your document now has both structure (chapters) and flow (narrative). Next options:

[A] **Create Detailed Outline** - Flesh out each section with key points
[B] **Start Writing** - Begin drafting with Quinn (Content Writer)
[C] **Return to Riley** - Discuss the project holistically

What's next? (Enter A, B, or C)"
