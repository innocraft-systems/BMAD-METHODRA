# Narrative Coherence Skill

Ensure your research document tells a coherent, compelling story.

## Quick Start

1. **Map the argument** - Identify thesis, claims, evidence chain
2. **Check logical flow** - Does each section build on previous?
3. **Verify transitions** - Are connections between sections clear?
4. **Test claim-evidence** - Is every claim adequately supported?
5. **Assess narrative arc** - Does it guide reader to conclusion?

## Coherence Framework

### Level 1: Sentence Coherence
Each sentence connects to the next:
- Topic continuity (same subject/theme)
- Logical connectors (therefore, however, additionally)
- Pronoun references clear
- No orphaned ideas

### Level 2: Paragraph Coherence
Each paragraph is a complete unit:
- Topic sentence states main point
- Supporting sentences develop the point
- All sentences relate to topic
- Concluding sentence transitions to next

### Level 3: Section Coherence
Each section serves document goals:
- Section purpose clear
- Subsections organized logically
- Evidence supports section claims
- Section advances overall argument

### Level 4: Document Coherence
The whole tells a unified story:
- Clear central thesis
- All parts serve the thesis
- Logical progression of ideas
- Satisfying conclusion

## Argument Mapping

### Thesis Statement Check
Your thesis should:
- State your main claim clearly
- Be specific and arguable
- Preview your approach
- Appear early (intro) and late (conclusion)

```markdown
## Thesis Analysis

**Central Thesis:**
[State the main argument in one sentence]

**Key Claims Supporting Thesis:**
1. Claim 1 → supported by [evidence]
2. Claim 2 → supported by [evidence]
3. Claim 3 → supported by [evidence]

**Logical Structure:**
IF [Claim 1] AND [Claim 2] AND [Claim 3]
THEN [Thesis] follows

**Validity Check:**
- Are claims true? [Y/N]
- Do claims logically support thesis? [Y/N]
- Are there counterarguments to address? [Y/N]
```

### Evidence Chain Mapping

```markdown
## Evidence Chain: [Claim]

**Claim:** [Statement being supported]

**Evidence Stack:**
1. [Evidence 1] - Type: [empirical/logical/testimonial]
   - Source: [citation]
   - Strength: [strong/moderate/weak]

2. [Evidence 2] - Type: [type]
   - Source: [citation]
   - Strength: [strength]

**Chain Logic:**
Evidence 1 establishes [X]
+ Evidence 2 establishes [Y]
→ Together they support [Claim] because [reasoning]

**Gaps Identified:**
- Missing evidence for [aspect]
- Counterargument not addressed: [counterargument]
```

## Transition Analysis

### Transition Types

**Additive** (adding information)
- Furthermore, moreover, in addition, also, additionally

**Adversative** (contrasting)
- However, nevertheless, on the other hand, conversely, yet

**Causal** (showing cause/effect)
- Therefore, thus, consequently, as a result, hence

**Sequential** (showing order)
- First, second, next, then, finally, subsequently

**Comparative** (showing similarity)
- Similarly, likewise, in the same way, comparably

### Section Transition Template

```markdown
[End of Section A: concluding sentence that signals completion]

[Transition: connect A to B, show why B follows]

[Beginning of Section B: topic sentence introducing new focus]
```

**Example:**
```
Having established the productivity benefits of remote work, we must
now consider the challenges organizations face in implementation.
[Transition: moves from benefits to challenges]

Implementation challenges fall into three categories: technological
infrastructure, management practices, and employee isolation.
[New section: introduces structure of next topic]
```

## Coherence Checklist

### Introduction
- [ ] Opens with engaging hook
- [ ] Establishes context/background
- [ ] States clear thesis
- [ ] Previews document structure
- [ ] Explains significance

### Body Sections
- [ ] Each section has clear purpose
- [ ] Section order is logical
- [ ] Transitions connect sections
- [ ] Evidence supports each claim
- [ ] Counterarguments addressed
- [ ] No tangents or digressions

### Conclusion
- [ ] Restates thesis (not verbatim)
- [ ] Summarizes key points
- [ ] Addresses "so what?"
- [ ] Provides closure
- [ ] Aligns with introduction

### Throughout
- [ ] Consistent terminology
- [ ] Clear pronoun references
- [ ] Appropriate hedging
- [ ] Balanced perspective
- [ ] Reader-appropriate tone

## Common Coherence Problems

### Problem: Missing Links
**Symptom:** Reader asks "how did we get here?"
**Fix:** Add transition explaining connection

### Problem: Unsupported Claims
**Symptom:** Claim appears without evidence
**Fix:** Add supporting evidence or qualify claim

### Problem: Tangent
**Symptom:** Interesting but irrelevant content
**Fix:** Remove or move to appendix if valuable

### Problem: Contradiction
**Symptom:** Earlier claim conflicts with later claim
**Fix:** Reconcile or explain evolution of argument

### Problem: Abrupt Ending
**Symptom:** Document stops without closure
**Fix:** Add conclusion that ties back to thesis

### Problem: Circular Reasoning
**Symptom:** Claim uses itself as evidence
**Fix:** Find independent evidence

## Narrative Arc Templates

### Problem-Solution Arc
```
1. Introduction: Establish the problem
2. Background: Context and history
3. Analysis: Why problem matters/persists
4. Solution: Your proposed approach
5. Evidence: Support for solution
6. Implementation: How to apply
7. Conclusion: Call to action
```

### Argument Arc
```
1. Introduction: State position
2. Context: Background and definitions
3. Argument 1: First supporting claim
4. Argument 2: Second supporting claim
5. Argument 3: Third supporting claim
6. Counterarguments: Address opposition
7. Conclusion: Reinforce position
```

### Investigation Arc
```
1. Introduction: Research question
2. Literature: What's known
3. Gap: What's unknown
4. Methodology: How we investigated
5. Findings: What we discovered
6. Discussion: What it means
7. Conclusion: Implications
```

### Proposal Arc
```
1. Executive Summary: Key points
2. Problem: What needs solving
3. Solution: What we propose
4. Approach: How we'll do it
5. Team: Who will do it
6. Resources: What's needed
7. Timeline: When it happens
8. Impact: Why it matters
```
