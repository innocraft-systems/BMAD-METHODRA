  Critical analysis and synthesis of research literature. Use this skill
  when you need to analyze sources, synthesize findings across multiple
  papers, identify themes and patterns, evaluate evidence quality, or
  build arguments from literature. Trigger on: "analyze this", "synthesize",
  "what does the evidence say", "compare findings", "evaluate sources",
  "build argument from literature", "literature review".

# Academic Analysis Skill

Transform collected sources into coherent analysis and synthesis.

## Quick Start

1. **Organize sources** - Group by theme, methodology, or finding
2. **Extract key claims** - Pull main arguments from each source
3. **Map relationships** - How sources agree, disagree, build on each other
4. **Identify patterns** - What themes emerge across sources
5. **Synthesize narrative** - Weave findings into coherent story

## Analysis Framework

### Level 1: Source-Level Analysis

For each source, extract:

```markdown
## Source Analysis: [Title]

### Central Argument
What is the main claim or thesis?

### Key Findings
- Finding 1 (with evidence type)
- Finding 2 (with evidence type)

### Methodology
- Approach: [qualitative/quantitative/mixed]
- Methods: [specific techniques]
- Sample: [who/what was studied]
- Limitations: [acknowledged weaknesses]

### Contribution
What does this add to the conversation?

### Credibility Assessment
- Author expertise: [high/medium/low]
- Publication quality: [tier 1/2/3]
- Methodology rigor: [high/medium/low]
- Potential biases: [identified conflicts]
```

### Level 2: Cross-Source Analysis

Map relationships between sources:

**Agreement Matrix**
| Topic | Source A | Source B | Source C | Consensus |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Claim 1 | Supports | Supports | Neutral | Strong |
| Claim 2 | Supports | Contradicts | Supports | Mixed |
| Claim 3 | Neutral | Supports | Supports | Moderate |

**Relationship Types**
- **Builds on**: Source B extends Source A's findings
- **Contradicts**: Sources present opposing findings
- **Complements**: Sources address different aspects
- **Replicates**: Source B confirms Source A's findings
- **Critiques**: Source B challenges Source A's methodology

### Level 3: Thematic Synthesis

Group findings into themes:

```markdown
## Theme: [Theme Name]

### Definition
What does this theme capture?

### Evidence Base
| Source | Finding | Evidence Strength |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Author (Year) | Key finding | Strong/Moderate/Weak |

### Synthesis
What does the evidence collectively tell us about this theme?

### Confidence Level
How confident can we be in these conclusions?

### Gaps
What remains unknown or underexplored?
```

## Synthesis Techniques

### Narrative Synthesis
Tell the story of how understanding has evolved:
- Historical development of ideas
- How methodologies have improved
- Where consensus has formed
- Where debates continue

### Conceptual Framework Building
Construct a model from the literature:
- Identify key variables
- Map relationships between variables
- Show boundary conditions
- Highlight mechanisms

### Critical Evaluation
Assess the state of knowledge:
- What do we know for certain?
- What is probable but uncertain?
- What is unknown?
- What are the methodological limitations?

## Common Analysis Patterns

### The Consensus Builder
When literature agrees, emphasize:
- Strength of agreement
- Diversity of methods reaching same conclusion
- Remaining nuances or edge cases

### The Controversy Navigator
When literature disagrees, explain:
- Nature of the disagreement
- Possible reasons for conflicting findings
- Which position has stronger evidence
- How to reconcile differences

### The Gap Identifier
When literature is silent, highlight:
- What questions remain unanswered
- Why the gap exists
- Implications of the gap
- How your work addresses it

### The Evolution Tracker
When ideas have developed over time:
- Original conception
- Key turning points
- Current state of thinking
- Future directions

## Writing Synthesis Paragraphs

**Structure for synthesis paragraphs:**

```
[Topic sentence stating the synthesized finding]
[Source 1] found that [finding]. Similarly, [Source 2] demonstrated [finding].
However, [Source 3] presents a nuanced view, suggesting [finding].
Taken together, these studies indicate that [synthesized conclusion],
though [limitation or caveat] should be noted.
```

**Example:**
```
Remote work generally improves employee productivity, though effects
vary by job type. Smith (2020) found a 13% productivity increase among
software developers working remotely. Similarly, Johnson (2021)
demonstrated improved output in customer service roles. However, Lee
(2022) presents a nuanced view, suggesting creative collaboration
suffers in fully remote settings. Taken together, these studies indicate
that remote work benefits individual-focused tasks, though team-based
creative work may require periodic in-person interaction.
```

## Quality Signals in Analysis

### Strong Analysis Shows:
- Multiple sources supporting claims
- Acknowledgment of contradictory evidence
- Clear methodology descriptions
- Appropriate hedging of uncertain claims
- Logical flow between points

### Weak Analysis Shows:
- Cherry-picked sources
- Ignored contradictions
- Overclaiming from limited evidence
- Missing methodology context
- Disjointed presentation

## Output Artifacts

### Literature Review Section
Structured narrative synthesizing sources by theme.

### Evidence Summary Table
Quick reference mapping claims to supporting sources.

### Conceptual Framework
Visual model of key concepts and relationships.

### Gap Analysis
Documented areas needing further research.

## Integration with Other Skills

- **research-discovery**: Receives sources for analysis
- **narrative-coherence**: Provides analyzed themes for structuring
- **citation-manager**: Coordinates source references
- **content-writer**: Feeds synthesis into draft sections
